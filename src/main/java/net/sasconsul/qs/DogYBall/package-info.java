/**
 * Created by sasconsul on 8/15/16.
 *
 * This is a game based on a dog chasing, catching and maybe eating a ball.
 *
 * My first idea was to build the game in Processing (see http://processing.org),
 * but I realized that I needed a physics engine that I could build unit tests
 * against.
 *
 * This lead me to the JBox2d library (see http://jbox2d.org .)
 *
 * For the modeling I have not connected the engine to the objects.
